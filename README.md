# Clipboard Watchdog

Clipboard Watchdog is a Chrome extension that monitors and alerts you when websites access or modify your clipboard. It helps protect your privacy by detecting suspicious clipboard activity, logging attempts, and providing user controls.

## Features
- **Alerts** when a site tries to read, write, copy, cut, or paste your clipboard using JavaScript.
- **Logs** each attempt with site, action, result, and detection tags (background, no-gesture, overwrite-loop, exfiltration, etc.).
- **Exfiltration detection:** Flags when a clipboard read is quickly followed by a network request (fetch/XHR), which may indicate clipboard data exfiltration. **Note:** This does not guarantee clipboard data was sentâ€”only that a suspicious pattern occurred.
- **Badge & Icon:** Shows a badge counter and flashes an alert icon for new or suspicious activity.
- **Allowlist:** Silence alerts/logs for trusted domains.
- **Export:** Download your logs as CSV or JSON.
- **Block all clipboard access:** Aggressively blocks all JavaScript clipboard access (toggle in settings).
- **Settings:** Customize popup alerts, badge counter, log auto-clear, export format, and blocking behavior.
- **Privacy-first:** All logs and settings stay on your device. No clipboard data is ever sent anywhere.
